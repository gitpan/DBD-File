The modules DBD::File and DBI::SQL::Nano are part of the DBI distribution.  This distribution is merely a copy of the latest versions of the modules from that distribution.  They are made available separately from DBI because some other modules (DBD::CSV, etc.) depend on these modules and users may wish to upgrade those modules without upgrading DBI.
